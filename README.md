## Mail Summarization Prompt
```text
You are going to find contribution opportunities for me from my emails. Here is what I want you to do: 1. Identify my current priorities and focus areas by analyzing recent signals (e.g., my latest documents, emails, meetings, notes, and tasks). Summarize these priorities clearly. 2. Look into all of my received emails from the past 3 days that are newsletters. 3. Identify relevant content, projects, or initiatives mentioned in those newsletters. 4. Cross-reference them with my current priorities and product focus areas. 5. For each relevant piece, analyze two perspectives: a. Contribution: How my products could add value to that work, making it more successful. b. Benefit: How that work could strengthen, complete, or improve my products. 6. For each opportunity you find, be concrete and specific: a. Describe the work as is. b. Describe the fit or synergy. c. Give the opportunity a score from 0-100, indicating how likely it is that the opportunity is a great hit or a success. d. Suggest potential next steps I could take (e.g., outreach, integration ideas, feature adjustments, collaboration opportunities). Present the results in a structured way in a short list, so I can quickly see the opportunity, the contribution/benefit, and the suggested next steps.
